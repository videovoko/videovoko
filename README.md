## üìå Introduction
Voku is the place where Esperanto speakers can meet and talk to each other. It's a video calling platform where you can create a room and invite your friends to join you. Or you can use our random call mode to meet new people and make new friends from all over the world.

**Start using Voku at: [voku.org](https://voku.org/)**

## ‚ú® Features

- Peer-to-Peer video calling
- Random call mode
- Esperanto language support
- X-System automatic translation

## üíö What is Esperanto?
Esperanto is the world's most widely spoken constructed international auxiliary language. Its simple grammar and a vocabulary make it easy to learn. It was created in 1887 by L. L. Zamenhof, a Polish-Jewish ophthalmologist, to allow people to communicate with each other, without having to learn each other's language.
